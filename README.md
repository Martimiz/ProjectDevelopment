Testing xCode 12 Example with Github

Create an xCode Project with a git repository, then add a remote from the SourceControl panel in the navigator. Then push the project from the SourceControl menu. 

Github now promps you to add a README.md file, which I did (obviously). A subsequent pull did not seem to download this file. I've read multiple complaints where xCode could now no longer sync with the remote. For now this didn't happeen

Back again after committing and pushing a useless property. Still working...

So - this README.md is actually copied to the local repository, it just isn't added to the xCode Project. I can still do that by dragging it into the Project (directly underneath the main project name.) 

And hoooray, works
